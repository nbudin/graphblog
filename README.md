# Graphblog

This is a demo app based on David Heinemeier Hansson's classic "blog in 15 minutes" demo, but built in Rails 6 using Bootstrap 4.  I used it as an example in a tech talk to show how to add a GraphQL API to an existing Rails app.

If you want to follow along with the process of adding the GraphQL API, [start here](https://github.com/nbudin/graphblog/pull/1/commits/6b656e994bd467ecb7f3c0da717c5624319ef9d8) and browse through the commits one-by-one.
